# Hi there 👋, My name is Manu krishnan

A passionate MERN stack developer with a knack for crafting robust web applications. With a track record of completing over 5 projects utilizing the MERN stack, I thrive in building scalable and efficient solutions.

📱 Additionally, I've delved into the world of mobile development and have successfully delivered 2 projects using React Native. Exploring cross-platform possibilities excites me, and I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies and methodologies.
